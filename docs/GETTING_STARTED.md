# Getting Started with Lyra

Welcome! This guide is for complete beginners. No coding experience needed.

## What is Lyra?

Lyra is a free website where you can learn to build apps on blockchain (like Ethereum). You write code in your browser and see it work instantly.

## What is blockchain?

Think of blockchain as a shared notebook that everyone can read, but no one can erase. When you write something in it (like "send 10 coins to Alice"), it stays there forever and everyone can verify it happened.

## What is a smart contract?

A smart contract is like a vending machine on the blockchain. You put something in (like money), and it automatically does something (like giving you a token). Once you set the rules, they can't be changed.

## Your First 5 Minutes

### Step 1: Open Lyra
Go to [lyra.works](https://lyra.works) in your browser.

### Step 2: Pick a tutorial
Scroll down to "Learn Web3 Development" and click on a beginner tutorial.

### Step 3: Read and experiment
Each tutorial has:
- **Explanation** on the left
- **Code** on the right
- **Run button** to see it work

Change the code and see what happens!

## Common Questions

### Do I need to pay for anything?
No. Lyra is 100% free. When you're learning, you use "fake" blockchain money (testnet ETH), which is also free.

### Do I need to install anything?
No. Everything runs in your browser.

### Do I need a "wallet"?
Not to start learning. When you're ready to deploy to a real blockchain, you'll need MetaMask (a free browser extension).

### What language do I need to learn?
Solidity - it's the language for Ethereum smart contracts. It looks similar to JavaScript. Lyra teaches you step by step.

### I don't know JavaScript. Can I still learn?
Yes! Some programming experience helps, but we explain concepts as we go. Start with the "Complete Beginner" tutorials.
